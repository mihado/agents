## Enqueue Workflows from External Applications

Use `client.enqueue()` to submit workflows from outside the DBOS application. Must specify workflow and queue names explicitly.

**Incorrect (missing required options):**

```python
from dbos import DBOSClient

client = DBOSClient(system_database_url=db_url)

# Missing workflow_name and queue_name!
handle = client.enqueue({}, task_data)
```

**Correct (with required options):**

```python
from dbos import DBOSClient, EnqueueOptions

client = DBOSClient(system_database_url=db_url)

# Optionally register the queue from the client (persists to system database)
client.register_queue("task_queue", global_concurrency=10)

options: EnqueueOptions = {
    "workflow_name": "process_task",  # Required
    "queue_name": "task_queue",       # Required
}
handle = client.enqueue(options, task_data)
result = handle.get_result()
client.destroy()
```

The queue does not need to exist when `enqueue` is called. If no queue with the given name has been registered, the workflow is still durably recorded as `ENQUEUED` and starts running once the queue is registered and a worker becomes available.

`workflow_name` is the workflow's registered name: the `name` passed to `@DBOS.workflow`, or by default the function's `__qualname__` (no module prefix, e.g. `process_task` or `URLFetcher.fetch_workflow`).

Optional parameters:

```python
options: EnqueueOptions = {
    "workflow_name": "process_task",
    "queue_name": "task_queue",
    "workflow_id": "custom-id-123",
    "workflow_id_reuse_policy": "reject",   # or "return-existing" (default)
    "workflow_timeout": 300,
    "deduplication_id": "user-123",         # not supported on partitioned queues
    "duplication_policy": "return-existing", # singleton: attach to the existing workflow
    "priority": 1,
    "delay_seconds": 60,                    # Delay before becoming eligible
    # "queue_partition_key": "user-123",    # required on partitioned queues (use instead of deduplication_id)
    "app_version": "1.0.0",                 # unset = dequeued by the latest version
    "authenticated_user": "alice",
    "authenticated_roles": ["admin"],
    "attributes": {"customer": "acme"},     # searchable via list_workflows(attributes=...) (Postgres only)
    "application_name": "order-service",    # owning app, if the system DB is shared
}
```

- `workflow_id_reuse_policy="reject"` raises `DBOSWorkflowIDInUseError` if the ID exists.
- `duplication_policy="return-existing"` requires `deduplication_id`; the colliding caller's arguments are discarded and the handle resolves with the original workflow's result. Otherwise a collision raises `DBOSQueueDeduplicatedError`.
- Also available: `serialization_type` (see [advanced-serialization](advanced-serialization.md)) and `otel_context` (propagate an OpenTelemetry trace context).
- `max_recovery_attempts` is not an enqueue option; set it on `@DBOS.workflow(max_recovery_attempts=...)`.

### Enqueueing Class Methods

To enqueue a `@classmethod` workflow, set `class_name`; for a method on a configured instance, set both `class_name` and `instance_name` (the instance's `config_name`). The class and instance must be registered in the application that dequeues the workflow. Static methods need neither.

```python
options: EnqueueOptions = {
    "queue_name": "example_queue",
    "workflow_name": "URLFetcher.fetch_workflow",
    "class_name": "URLFetcher",
    "instance_name": "https://example.com",
}
handle = client.enqueue(options)
```

### Enqueue or Send Inside Your Own Transaction

Three client methods write inside a caller-owned SQLAlchemy transaction, so they commit or roll back atomically with your own writes:

```python
client.enqueue_in_transaction(conn_or_session, options: EnqueueOptions, *args, **kwargs) -> WorkflowHandle
client.send_in_transaction(conn_or_session, destination_id, message, topic=None, idempotency_key=None,
                           *, serialization_type=..., send_to_forks=False) -> None
client.send_bulk_in_transaction(conn_or_session, messages: List[SendMessage],
                                *, serialization_type=..., send_to_forks=False) -> None
```

**Incorrect (separate transactions: a crash between them loses or orphans work):**

```python
with engine.begin() as conn:
    conn.execute(text("INSERT INTO orders (id) VALUES (:id)"), {"id": order_id})
client.enqueue(options, order_id)  # not atomic with the insert
```

**Correct (one transaction):**

```python
import os
import sqlalchemy as sa
from sqlalchemy import text
from dbos import DBOSClient, EnqueueOptions, SendMessage

client = DBOSClient(system_database_url=os.environ["DBOS_SYSTEM_DATABASE_URL"])

# Must target the DBOS **system** database. For Postgres, use the psycopg (v3) driver
# DBOS installs; a plain postgresql:// URL makes SQLAlchemy look for psycopg2.
engine = sa.create_engine(
    sa.make_url(os.environ["DBOS_SYSTEM_DATABASE_URL"]).set(drivername="postgresql+psycopg")
)

options: EnqueueOptions = {"queue_name": "orders", "workflow_name": "process_order"}
order_id = "order-123"
payment_workflow_id = "payment-order-123"  # IDs of workflows waiting on recv
wf_a, wf_b = "listener-a", "listener-b"

# The orders table in this example lives in the system database, since conn is connected to it
with engine.begin() as conn:
    conn.execute(text("INSERT INTO orders (id) VALUES (:id)"), {"id": order_id})
    handle = client.enqueue_in_transaction(conn, options, order_id)
    client.send_in_transaction(conn, payment_workflow_id, "paid", "payment_status",
                               idempotency_key=f"paid-{order_id}")
    client.send_bulk_in_transaction(conn, [
        SendMessage(wf_a, "order-created", "events"),
        SendMessage(wf_b, "order-created", "events"),
    ])
# Nothing is enqueued or sent until the transaction commits

result = handle.get_result()  # Only after commit
```

- Pass a SQLAlchemy `Connection` or ORM `Session` on the **system** database; the write can't atomically span a separate app database.
- You own the transaction: these methods don't begin, commit, roll back, or retry on DB errors.
- `enqueue_in_transaction` takes the same options as `enqueue`, except `duplication_policy="return-existing"` (raises `DBOSException`). Its handle exists immediately, but don't call `get_result()` before commit.
- Messages are not visible to the destination workflow until commit.
- No async variants; from async code, bridge with `await conn.run_sync(lambda sync_conn: client.send_in_transaction(sync_conn, dest, msg))` on an `AsyncConnection` inside `async with conn.begin()`.
