## Use Queues for Concurrent Workflows

Queues run many workflows concurrently with managed flow control. Use them when you need to control how many workflows run at once.

**Incorrect (uncontrolled concurrency):**

```go
// Starting many workflows without control - could overwhelm resources
for _, task := range tasks {
	dbos.RunWorkflow(ctx, processTask, task)
}
```

**Correct (using a queue):**

```go
// Register the queue - its configuration is persisted in the system database
queue, err := dbos.RegisterQueue(ctx, "task_queue")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

func processAllTasks(ctx dbos.Context, tasks []string) ([]string, error) {
	var handles []dbos.WorkflowHandle[string]
	for _, task := range tasks {
		handle, err := dbos.RunWorkflow(ctx, processTask, task,
			dbos.WithQueue(queue),
		)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		handles = append(handles, handle)
	}
	// Wait for all tasks
	var results []string
	for _, h := range handles {
		result, err := h.GetResult()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		results = append(results, result)
	}
	return results, nil
}
```

Queues process workflows in FIFO order. Create queues with `dbos.RegisterQueue`, which persists the configuration in the system database and returns a `dbos.Queue` handle to pass to `dbos.WithQueue`.

Each queue is owned by the application that registers it, and only that application dequeues workflows from it — this matters when multiple applications [share a system database](advanced-shared-database.md). List queues with `dbos.ListQueues(ctx)`, which defaults to the calling application's queues; pass `dbos.WithListQueuesApplicationNames(names...)` to list other applications' queues.
